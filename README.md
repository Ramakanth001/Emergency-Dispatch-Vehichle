# Emergency-Dispatch-Vehichle
The objective of this project is to find and allocate an available emergency vehicle, taking 
source and destination as inputs and providing an optimum path during the course of travel.

# Dijkstra algorithm

>>Algorithm working
During the course of travel since the traffic density isnâ€™t constant, different traffic 
densities are allocated between each of the locations. The densities range from low to 
very high. As the traffic density increases, weight of the path is increased. So the 
distance and traffic densities are deciding factors for weight of that particular path. 
Based on the weight, routing is organized. Shortest weighed path is chosen as optimal path.
