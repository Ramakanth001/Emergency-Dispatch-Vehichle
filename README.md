# Emergency-Dispatch-Vehichle with Re-Routing
> The objective of this project is to find and allocate an available emergency vehicle, taking 
> source and destination as inputs and providing an optimum path during the course of travel.
> In case of difficulties during admission into the hosipital re-routing can be opted within a 
> grace period of ten minutes to a different hosipital.

# Dijkstra algorithm
Dijkstra algorithm was devised to find the shortest distance between two nodes. This algorithm 
is also called as single source shortest path approach. Dijkstra works affectively on large network
of nodes. It works on relaxation principle and fails to work on negative edges.

> **Approach:**
>> *Relaxation principle:*
>>>  
>>>         if(!visited[i]) :
>>>           if(minDistance + cost[nextNode][i] < distance[i]) :
>>>             distance[i] = minDistance + cost[nextNode][i] 
>>>          where, 
>>>           cost[i][j]=graph[i][j]+traffic_graph[i][j];

> During the course of travel since the traffic density isnâ€™t constant, different traffic 
> densities are allocated between each of the locations. The densities range from low to 
> very high. As the traffic density increases, weight of the path is increased. So the 
> distance and traffic densities are deciding factors for weight of that particular path. 
> Based on the weight, routing is organized. Shortest weighed path is chosen as optimal path.


# Re-Routing
> **Necessity:**
> Ambulances usually take a lot of time to arrive and there is no guarantee that an ambulance 
> would be allocated to the user. If for any reason the admission is rejected then the users 
> need not waste their time in checkin for a different ambulance rather ro-route in the same 
> ambulance. The grace period offered to opt for re-routing is ten minutes

> **Working:**
> When the source location is selected, the user is asked to either choose a hospital or a 
> nearby hospital would be allocated. If due to any technical reasons like non availability 
> of hospital beds, closed admissions, lack of medical equipment in destined hospital or 
> need of increase in criticality of case and advanced medical supervision is required, the 
> status of admission is recorded and re-routing to a different hospital gets enabled.
